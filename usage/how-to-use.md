# 🖥 How to use

Using this library is very simple! Just use the `ShoutStats.Core` namespace in any piece of code you want to use the library, as in: `using ShoutStats.Core;`

Once you have the server host name and the port, you can create a new instance of the `ShoutcastServer` class to fetch the following info from the server:

* `ServerHost`
  * Server IP address
* `ServerPort`
  * Server port used by Shoutcast
* `ServerHostFull`
  * Server IP address with port
* `ServerHttps`
  * Whether the Shoutcast server is using HTTPS or not
* `ServerVersion`
  * Server version (1.x, 2.x)
* `TotalStreams`
  * Total number of streams in the server
* `ActiveStreams`
  * Active streams in the server
* `CurrentListeners`
  * How many people are listening to the server at this time?
* `PeakListeners`
  * How many listeners did the server ever get at peak times?
* `MaxListeners`
  * How many people can listen to the server?
* `UniqueListeners`
  * How many unique listeners are there?
* `AverageTime`
  * Average time on any active listener connections in seconds
* `AverageTimeSpan`
  * Average time on any active listener connections in the time span
* `Streams`
  * Available streams and their statistics

Stream information class, `StreamInfo`, contains the following variables:

* `StreamId`
  * Stream ID starting from number one (1)
* `CurrentListeners`
  * How many people are listening to the stream at this time?
* `PeakListeners`
  * How many listeners did the stream ever get at peak times?
* `MaxListeners`
  * How many people can listen to the stream?
* `UniqueListeners`
  * How many unique listeners are there?
* `AverageTime`
  * Average time on any active listener connections in seconds
* `AverageTimeSpan`
  * Average time on any active listener connections in the time span
* `StreamGenre` -> `StreamGenre5`
  * The stream genre
* `StreamHomepage`
  * Link to the stream homepage
* `StreamTitle`
  * Stream title
* `SongTitle`
  * Song title
* `StreamHits`
  * Stream hits
* `StreamStatus`
  * Stream status
* `BackupStatus`
  * Backup stream status
* `StreamListed`
  * Is the stream listed?
* `StreamPath`
  * Path to stream
* `StreamUptime`
  * Stream uptime in seconds
* `StreamUptimeSpan`
  * Stream uptime in the time span
* `BitRate`
  * Stream bitrate in kbps
* `SampleRate`
  * Sampling rate in Hz
* `MimeInfo`
  * MIME info for stream, usually audio/mpeg.

You can use this library to make an application that fetches info from your Shoutcast server for analytical purposes.
